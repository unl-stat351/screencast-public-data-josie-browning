Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- What season's crops yeild the highest average health value?
- What fish is the hardest to catch in terms of rarity?
- What are all the monsters that could be found on level 20 of the Mines?

Stat 351 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Scrapping data from the website and formatting it into a table
2. Data cleaning and using tidyverse
3. Visualization/graphics of data findings 
4. Use APIs in some capacity (I don't know what they are yet)
